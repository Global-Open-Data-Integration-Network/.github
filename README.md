# Welcome to GODIN

This repository is part of the **[Global Open Data Integration Network (GODIN)](https://godin.gleif.org/)** initiative. It contains a collection of open-source code that showcases practical use cases with data from GODIN members. Each use case focuses on a specific topic and provides hands-on examples that enable data users to:

- Work with member data in real-world scenarios
- Adapt workflows to their own projects
- Build on shared, reproducible code
- Connect and interoperate across diverse data sets

Jointly developed by GODIN members, this initiative fosters innovation and collaboration throughout the open data ecosystem.
